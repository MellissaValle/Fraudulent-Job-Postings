Can’t tell if a job posting is legit? Unfortunately, there are a lot of scammers out there that can and will take advantage of jobseekers. So if you think a job posting isn’t real, it probably isn’t, we humans can have an idea how to detect those, one by one. But how much time would it take a company like Indeed to accurately identify and take down thousands and thousands of fraudulent job postings? 
#### There are several reasons why fake job posting exists: 
1. Actual employers without any intention to hire anyone but might be just testing the waters, to see what talents are out there.
2. Some spammers who would get the jobseeker’s email address and then sell it to other individuals. 
3. And lastly the Scammers, criminals who want to steal money or even the individual’s identity.
